        <p>
          I have had a lot of diverse opportunities as an intern: a law firm, UFSC&apos;s internal
          affairs office, Municipal Court of Palho√ßa and a bank (BRDE). Through these opportunities
          I could work in the public and private sector, and different law contexts as well.
        </p>

          While working at my day to day activities, I realized that I could automate a lot of what
          I was doing, and it sparked an instering in learning basic concepts of programming.
          Nowadays I am an aspiring full-stack web developer, studying at Trybe.
